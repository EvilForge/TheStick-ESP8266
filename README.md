# The8266Stick
An ESP8266 GPS Geocaching Walking Stick. (No.. seriously..)

## Overview:
Trying to push an ESP8266 to its limits, I suppose.

I *still* find Geocaching fun. I don't do it near as much however. But I've got the gear.. or do I?  I mean I have a walking stick (custom made of course with built in LED headlights, and a compass on the top). And I have a GPS. And I have a phone and watch to track my distance. 

But I don't have a walking stick that takes the place of "everything" above. (Yet)

So it's time to remedy that. Ouila, the ESP8266 GPS Geocaching Walking Stick was born.

The GPS works, the sensors work, the LED's work, the code is starting to come together (minus the wifi parts, and web server, just yet). I even have the new stick cut up and places to mount the pixels, battery holders (still debating on that.. it needs a quick way to swap an 18650).

The code is in initial stages with most of the components I need working.. so.. here's the first upload.

NOTE that I have a day job I have to pay attention to (which is surprising, since I work for the govt you'd think I could screw around all day, right?) So updates may be intermittent. But I have high hopes..
